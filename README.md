# ▶️▶️▶️ A YouTube Video Downloader ▶️▶️▶️
Here is my final project for Code In Place 2021, you can see it on [here](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/2021/showcase/174) as well.

I wrote a small script to download Youtube videos. Simply paste your URLs and go through certain options

There are some limitations:
####  📩 Due to each video having different codecs, this program can only download either 720p videos with sound or 1080p videos without sound.
####  ♌️ You can download seperated audios for 1080p videos, but the audios would be in .webm format
####  🌬 There are only 4 options (C/D/E/F) for which disk to save videos in. 
####  📖 If you want to save videos in a folder, you need to download the videos and create folders by yourself, and move the videos in.


## That's it! I hope you enjoy using this program! There are still limitations, so any comments are welcomed!
