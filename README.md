# youtube_video_downloader
Here is my final project for Code In Place 2021 :) There are still limitations, so any comments are welcomed!

I wrote a small program to download Youtube videos. Simply paste your URLs and go through certain options

There are some limitations:
# Due to each video having different codecs, this program can only download either 720p videos with sound or 1080p videos without sound.
# You can download seperated audios for 1080p videos, but the audios would be in .webm format
# There are only 4 options (C/D/E/F) for which disk to save videos in. 
# If you want to save videos in a folder, you need to download the videos and create folders by yourself, and move the videos in.


That's it! I hope you enjoy using this program!
